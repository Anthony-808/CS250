How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  I discern what they want and why the want it. Then I plan the best way to implement the users need. After that I write and test the code.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I normally think about what components the program will need and what functions or classes I'll need to create those components. I then begin writing the code. Usually while coding I'll find some problem I didn't     anticipate or an issue with my planning. Once that happens I spend time re-planning or researching how to overcome the problem. I keep doing the coding/re-plannign cycle until the program is done. I'm not sure        where Agile processes come into this since I've never collaborated on a program. But I really like the idea of short iteration cycles and constant feedback/review. I would like use some form of that for coding and    other forms of learning/self-improvement.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  I think a good team member in software development means being a good collaborator. This means someone who communicates well, follows through with their commitments, and actively learns. Being able to write           readable, secure, and adaptable code is probably pretty important too.
